   The team that does not own the rights to the player will be called the Non-Owning Team. 
   * The right of first refusal is the right to enter into a transaction for a player before another team can. If the team with this right declines to enter into a transaction, other teams are allowed to complete that transaction. 
2. Scope of Rights
   * Owning the DEP rights to a player allows the team to: 
   * Have the right of first refusal to loan that player.
   * Have the right of first refusal to call up that player.
3. Loans
   * A DEP can be loaned at any point during the regular season and playoffs.
   * If the Owning Team would like to loan a player, they should submit the roster transaction form to the CRC to formalize the loan. 
   * If a Non-Owning Team would like to loan a player they should submit the roster transaction form to the CRC to request the loan. The CRC will contact the Owning Team to inform them of the intended loan. 
4. Call Ups
   * A DEP can be called up at any point during the regular season. 
   * If the Owning Team would like to call up a player, they should submit the roster transaction form to the CRC to formalize the call up. 
   * If a Non-Owning Team wishes to call up a player, they should submit the roster transaction form to request the call up. At this point, the CRC will inform the Owning Team of the intended call up. 
   * The Owning Team will have the right of first refusal. Therefore, the owning team can choose to drop a player to call up the player in question. 
   * Teams can execute a trade before forfeiting their rights to the player.
   * If the Owning Team does not add the player within the FA period (Tuesday at Midnight ET), then the player will be added to the Non-Owning Team’s roster. 
   * A player can decline to be called up. At this point any DEP rights are forfeited and the team can claim rights to any unclaimed player. The declining player is also barred from being called up for the remainder of the season.
5. Handling of Dropped Players
   * In the instance that an Owning Team forgoes the right of first refusal, they will have the first choice in picking up the player that is dropped for the DEP. Otherwise the player will continue into MLTP FA. 
   * If the player is not picked up in MLTP FA, then the team whose DEP was claimed  receives the rights of the dropped player as a DEP. 
   * Dropped players will not be eligible to be added to a mLTP roster until the conclusion of Week 4. Between being dropped and this period, the dropped player can be loaned or called up by any MLTP teams.
   * EXCEPTION: If the called up player no longer wishes to play mLTP, then the dropped player will be added to the mLTP roster losing their player. This player then becomes dual-eligible for MLTP and mLTP. 
6. Add/Drop of Rights
   * MLTP teams can add and drop rights at any time. They will be processed on a first-come-first-serve basis. 
Eligible rights for players are any players on a mLTP or NLTP roster.
